# AP-PA (Adaptive-Patch-based Physical Attack)

## Introduction

Adversarial patches generated by existing algorithms are not strong enough and extremely time-consuming. Moreover, the complicated physical factors are not accommodated well during the optimization process. In this paper, a novel adaptive-patch-based physical attack (AP-PA) framework is proposed to alleviate the above problems. We summarize our algorithm in [Benchmarking Adversarial Patch Against Aerial Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9965436).

## Requirements:

* Pytorch 1.10

* Python 3.6
